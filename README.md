# Angular Frontend for ASP.NET Web API
This Angular frontend interacts with the ASP.NET Web API providing a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing contacts. The Angular application consumes the backend API, allowing users to list, create, update, and delete contacts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Angular application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (Command Line Interface)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/steveebenezer/contact-manager-client.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd contact-manager-client
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Development Server

Run the Angular application in development mode using the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng serve
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
